glusterfs-debian
================

What is this?
---------------

This is the source package for [glusterfs] that will be used in the next release of Debian GNU/Linux (known as unstable or sid.)

Most of the time this repository has the same source package as the official [sid repository] does.  From time to time however there may be a delay in publishing to the official repository, so it's available here too.


How do I use it?
---------------

  - Download the official glusterfs release [source tarball]
  - Rename it to glusterfs_X.Y.Z-R.orig.tar.gz for the version of this source package.  For example if the top of debian/changelog says version 3.3.0-1 then the source tarball should be named glusterfs_3.3.0-1.orig.tar.gz
  - Untar it
  - Copy the debian/ subfolder from this repository into the root of the glusterfs source tree
  - Run debuild In the root of the glusterfs source tree (I use debuild -S -sa)
  - Go up a folder then you can use pbuilder to build the package from the dsc file which was just generated by debuild.  (pbuilder --build glusterfs_X.Y.Z-R.dsc)
