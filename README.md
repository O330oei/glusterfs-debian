glusterfs-debian
================

What is this?
---------------

This is the packaging source for [glusterfs] that is used to build the community Debian & Ubuntu packages of glusterfs, glusterd2, glusterfs-core-utils, storhaug, etc., on [download.gluster.org] and in the Community GlusterFS [Launchpad PPAs], respectively.

Instructions for adding the PPA are on the [Launchpad PPAs] web page.

The interesting stuff is in branches dedicated to glusterfs & distro releases.

Attention: If you're trying to install GlusterFS on, e.g. Bionic, and you're getting GlusterFS-3.13, this is an indication that you haven't added/installed the PPA and are getting the packages from the Ubuntu base repository. If that's really what you want, contact Canonical for support.
